;; `kotoba/gif/blocks.kotoba` against `gif.core/parse`.
;;
;; Parity covers the header fields the library reads correctly: dimensions,
;; version, and whether a global colour table is present. The fixtures are
;; the repo's own `.gif` files, so agreement is against something neither
;; side made up.
;;
;; The FRAME COUNT is where they part, and the test says so rather than
;; picking a winner quietly. `parse` reports
;;
;;   :frames (count (filter #(= % 0x2C) bv))
;;
;; and 0x2C is the Image Separator AND the ASCII comma.
;; `a-comma-in-a-comment-is-not-a-frame` inserts one legal GIF89a Comment
;; Extension containing a comma and shows the oracle answering two for a
;; file with one image descriptor.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the header and is not required from the
;; guest (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy of the walk.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;;   * `a-comma-in-a-comment-is-not-a-frame` — the defect, demonstrated
;;     rather than described;
;;   * `a-frame-count-is-not-offered-mid-walk` — a count taken before the
;;     trailer is a lower bound presented as an answer;
;;   * `a-truncated-file-is-refused-before-the-read` — a colour-table size
;;     and a sub-block length both come from the file, and asking for a
;;     range that runs past the end is the out-of-range read;
;;   * `an-unknown-block-is-not-a-truncated-file` — losing sync and running
;;     out of bytes are different facts and get different reasons.
